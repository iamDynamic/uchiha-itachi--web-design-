            When war-torn times threatened the Uchiha clan, one man chose the
            path <br />
            of shadows to protect the light. Burdened with unimaginable
            decisions, <br />
            he walked alone, shouldering the weight of betrayal to ensure peace.
            But <br />
            the truth behind his sacrifice would one day pierce through the veil
            of <br />
            hatred, revealing the legacy he left behind.

      <p>
        Born into the prestigious Uchiha clan, Itachi and Sasuke shared a bond
        <br />
        shaped by love, rivalry, and tragedy. Itachi, a prodigy burdened with
        <br />
        protecting the village, made the ultimate sacrifice, massacring their
        <br />
        clan to prevent a civil war—yet sparing his younger brother. Sasuke,
        <br />
        consumed by hatred and a thirst for vengeance, vowed to destroy the
        <br />
        brother he once idolized. Their journey intertwined destiny and <br />
        deception, culminating in a battle where the truth was finally revealed.
        <br />
        Itachi’s actions, driven by love and duty, left Sasuke grappling with
        <br />
        his identity and the meaning of justice.

        <p>
          Itachi Uchiha's mastery of the Sharingan, the dōjutsu (visual ability)
          <br />
          of the Uchiha clan, is one of his most notable strengths. Here's a
          <br />
          breakdown of his Sharingan-related abilities:

      <p>
        Itachi excels in using the Sharingan to cast powerful illusions that can
        <br />
        trap opponents in mental worlds, making him a master of psychological
        <br />
        warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Sharingan allows him to predict and react to enemy movements with
        <br />
        incredible precision.

          The Mangekyo Sharingan is quite an incredible eye that offers <br>
          everything that a Sharingan does, only better and on a greater scale. <br>
          Just like the regular Sharingan, this eye can see through ninjutsu, <br>
          genjutsu, and taijutsu completely and copy jutsu that aren't Kekkei <br>
          Genkai.
